# Cancer Prediction & Diabetes Prediction

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains two machine learning models for **cancer** and **diabetes** prediction. Both models use logistic regression and feature scaling to provide accurate predictions based on medical data.

1. **Cancer Prediction** - Predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
2. **Diabetes Prediction** - Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data.

## 🏷 Project Structure
- **Backend:** Flask API deployed on Render
- **Frontend:** React-based UI
- **Model:** Logistic Regression trained on medical datasets

## 🚀 Features
✅ Accepts medical data as input  
✅ Pre-trained models for prediction  
✅ REST API for model inference  
✅ User-friendly React frontend  

## 🎯 Deployment
- **Backend:** Hosted on Render: [Cancer API](https://cancer-prediction-1-giqb.onrender.com/)
- **Frontend:** CodeSandbox (Integration in progress)

## 🗂 API Endpoints
- `POST /predict/cancer` - Predict cancer based on input data
- `POST /predict/diabetes` - Predict diabetes based on input data

## 📊 Model Details
- **Cancer Prediction:** Uses 30 features from a medical dataset.
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Uses features like glucose, BMI, and age.
